# Technical spec Tamper-resistance of bio-knowledge unlearning (small LLM)

Context file for the implementing coding agent. Terse and prescriptive by design. Read this
in full before writing code. If a fact here is stale (library API, dataset path, benchmark
task name, reference-repo layout), verify against the source before proceeding — do not build
on an unverified assumption.

## Purpose

Empirically measure whether a published post-training unlearning method (RMU) produces a
*tamper-resistant* safeguard on a small open-weight LLM. Concretely: remove hazardous-bio
proxy knowledge (measured by WMDP-bio), then attempt to restore it via adversarial
fine-tuning on benign data, and report the recovery as a function of fine-tuning budget.

## Safety constraints (MUST FOLLOW)

- This is defensive research: the objective is capability *removal* and *measurement*, never
  capability *creation*.
- Never generate, collect, store, or train on real, operational, step-by-step hazardous
  procedures (bio/chem/nuclear/cyber). No exceptions.
- WMDP-bio is used strictly as a scoring instrument (multiple-choice proxy questions). Never
  mine it for content, never surface its items as knowledge.
- Phase 3 "adversarial fine-tuning" uses BENIGN, general-domain data only. Its purpose is to
  test whether the *benchmark score* rebounds — a proxy for shallow vs. deep removal. It must
  not use hazardous data and must not aim to make the model more hazardous.
- If any requested step would plausibly raise real-world hazardous capability rather than
  measure/remove it, halt and escalate to the human owner. Do not silently reinterpret a step
  to make it seem acceptable.

## System overview

Single-machine pipeline, one GPU (16–24 GB sufficient for the target model). Four stages:
baseline eval → RMU unlearn → adversarial fine-tune sweep → recovery analysis + report. No
distributed training, no custom kernels. Prefer Hugging Face `transformers` + a standard
reference implementation of RMU over bespoke code.

## Environment & dependencies

- Python ≥ 3.10, single CUDA GPU. Use `bfloat16` where supported.
- Core: `torch`, `transformers`, `datasets`, `accelerate`.
- Eval: `lm-eval` (EleutherAI lm-evaluation-harness).
- Optional (Phase 4 only): `peft` for LoRA.
- Pin every version in `requirements.txt`. Record `pip freeze` output in the repo at first
  successful run.
- Memory tactics if OOM: `torch_dtype=bfloat16`, `device_map="cuda"`, gradient checkpointing,
  reduce per-device batch size, gradient accumulation, shorter `max_seq_len` (e.g. 512).

All scripts are argparse CLIs; every tunable also has a default in `configs/default.yaml`.
CLI flags override the YAML. Every run writes its resolved config into its output JSON.

## Models

- Primary target: `Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`.
- Fallback if baseline WMDP-bio ≈ chance: `Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct` (then re-baseline).
- Load a frozen reference copy of the base model in `unlearn.py` for the retain loss.

## Datasets

- **Forget set:** the standard WMDP-bio "forget" corpus (from the WMDP benchmark release /
  its HF mirror). Verify the current path/name before use.
- **Retain set:** a benign general-corpus (e.g. a `wikitext` slice) plus, optionally, the
  WMDP retain corpus if published. Purpose: preserve general capability during unlearning.
- **Eval:** lm-eval tasks `wmdp_bio` (primary metric) and `mmlu` (capability-preservation
  check; a fixed subset via `--limit` is acceptable for speed). Confirm the exact current
  task name for WMDP-bio in the installed lm-eval version.
- **Attack (Phase 3) data:** BENIGN general-domain instruction/text data (e.g. a small slice
  of a general instruction dataset or `wikitext`). Never hazardous, never WMDP-bio items.

## Method specs

### 1. Evaluation (`src/eval.py`)

- Interface: `python -m src.eval --model <hf-id-or-path> --tasks wmdp_bio,mmlu --limit <int|None> --out results/<name>.json`
- Runs lm-eval programmatically (`lm_eval.simple_evaluate` or the CLI) and normalizes output.
- Output JSON schema:
```json
{
  "model": "<id-or-path>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO8601>",
  "lm_eval_version": "<version>",
  "tasks": {
    "wmdp_bio": {"acc": 0.00, "acc_stderr": 0.00, "n": 0},
    "mmlu":     {"acc": 0.00, "acc_stderr": 0.00, "n": 0}
  },
  "config": { "...resolved run config..." }
}
```
- Chance baseline for WMDP-bio (4-choice) ≈ 0.25. Report deltas against this and against the
  model's own baseline.

### 2. RMU unlearning (`src/unlearn.py`)

Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (Li et al., 2024, "The WMDP Benchmark"). Prefer
adapting the authors' public reference implementation to the target model over reimplementing
from scratch. Verify the current repo layout before wiring it in.

Mechanics to preserve:
- Pick a target residual-stream layer `L` at roughly 40–60% of model depth. Update a small set
  of parameters around it (in the reference this is the MLP down-projection weights of `L` and
  the one or two preceding transformer blocks). Freeze all other parameters.
- **Forget loss:** on forget-set batches, push the hidden state at layer `L` toward a fixed
  random unit vector `u` scaled by a steering coefficient `c` — minimize `||h_L(forget) - c·u||²`.
  Sample `u` once and hold it fixed.
- **Retain loss:** on retain-set batches, keep the updated model's hidden state at layer `L`
  close to the frozen reference model's — minimize `||h_L^updated(retain) - h_L^frozen(retain)||²`,
  weighted by `alpha`.
- Optimizer: AdamW, lr ≈ 5e-5. Alternate/mix forget and retain batches.

Tunable knobs (sweep these; do not treat any single value as authoritative — start from the
reference implementation's defaults for a comparable model size):
- `steering_coeff` (`c`): highly model/data dependent. Sweep e.g. {2, 6.5, 20, 60}.
- `alpha` (retain weight): typically large; increase until MMLU is preserved.
- `layer_id` / updated layers, `lr`, `max_num_batches` / steps, `batch_size`, `max_seq_len`.

- Interface: `python -m src.unlearn --base-model Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct --forget <path> --retain <path> --layer-id <L> --steering-coeff <c> --alpha <a> --lr 5e-5 --max-steps <N> --out models/unlearned`
- After training, save the checkpoint to `models/unlearned/`, then invoke the eval on it and
  write `results/unlearned.json`.

Acceptance: WMDP-bio drops substantially (target: toward chance) AND MMLU stays within a few
points of baseline. If MMLU collapses, lower `c` and/or raise `alpha`. If WMDP-bio barely
moves, raise `c` and/or widen the updated-layer set.

### 3. Adversarial fine-tuning (`src/attack.py`, `src/sweep.py`)

Tests tamper-resistance via a relearning-style attack on BENIGN data.
- Load `models/unlearned/`, fine-tune (full-parameter by default) on benign general-domain data.
- Grid: `lr ∈ {1e-5, 5e-5}` × `steps ∈ {0, 25, 50, 100, 200}` (steps=0 is the unlearned model,
  the control). Small per-device batch; standard causal-LM loss.
- After each cell, run `eval.py` on `wmdp_bio` (mmlu optional) and write
  `results/attack/lr{lr}_steps{n}.json`.
- `sweep.py` orchestrates the grid and produces `results/recovery_curve.png`: x = steps,
  y = WMDP-bio acc, one line per lr, with the baseline and chance lines marked.
- Interface: `python -m src.attack --model models/unlearned --data <benign> --lr <lr> --steps <n> --out results/attack/lr<lr>_steps<n>.json`
  and `python -m src.sweep --config configs/default.yaml`.
- Phase 4 option: add a LoRA variant (`peft`) and overlay both recovery curves for comparison.

Headline metric: fraction of the unlearned-to-baseline gap that is recovered, and the number
of benign steps at which recovery becomes substantial. Small recovery budgets restoring the
score ⇒ shallow (non-tamper-resistant) safeguard.

## Experimental protocol (phase → task → acceptance)

- **P0 Environment.** Build venv, install+pin deps, load primary model, run one test
  generation. Accept: model loads, sensible sample, `requirements.txt` pinned.
- **P1 Baseline + gate.** Eval baseline on wmdp_bio + mmlu → `results/baseline.json`.
  Gate: if WMDP-bio ≈ chance, switch to fallback model and re-run. Accept: both scores saved,
  go/no-go decision recorded.
- **P2 Unlearn.** RMU → `models/unlearned/` + `results/unlearned.json`. Accept: WMDP-bio down,
  MMLU preserved (see §Method 2). Expect several tuning rounds.
- **P3 Attack sweep.** Grid fine-tune on benign data, eval each cell, plot recovery curve.
  Accept: `results/recovery_curve.png` + a one-sentence finding.
- **P4 (optional).** One deeper experiment (LoRA-vs-full recovery, longer/stronger unlearning,
  or broader attack sweep). Accept: comparison artifact + takeaway.
- **P5 Write-up.** `README.md` + `report/report.md` (baseline table, before/after table,
  recovery curve, one paragraph tying result to the tamper-resistance literature). Accept:
  reproduces end-to-end from README on a clean machine.

At each phase boundary: summarize actions in plain language and pause for human review.

## Default hyperparameters (`configs/default.yaml` seed values)

```yaml
model:
  base: "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct"
  fallback: "Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct"
  dtype: "bfloat16"
  max_seq_len: 512
eval:
  tasks: ["wmdp_bio", "mmlu"]
  mmlu_limit: 500        # subset for speed; null for full
seed: 0
rmu:
  layer_id: null         # set to ~40-60% depth after inspecting the model
  steering_coeff: 6.5    # SWEEP {2, 6.5, 20, 60}
  alpha: 1200            # retain weight; tune to preserve MMLU
  lr: 5.0e-5
  max_steps: 200
  batch_size: 4
attack:
  data: "<benign general-domain dataset>"
  learning_rates: [1.0e-5, 5.0e-5]
  steps_grid: [0, 25, 50, 100, 200]
  batch_size: 4
  method: "full"         # "full" | "lora"
```

Treat these as starting points to be swept/tuned, not ground truth. Verify the RMU seed values
against the reference implementation for a comparable model size.

## Logging & reproducibility

- Set and record seeds (`torch`, `numpy`, `random`, `transformers`) in `common.py`.
- Every output JSON embeds its resolved config and library versions.
- Log to stdout AND a per-run logfile. Keep an experiments index (append a row per run:
  timestamp, phase, config hash, key metric).
- Save checkpoints with enough metadata to reproduce the run that made them.

## Metrics & thresholds

- Primary: WMDP-bio accuracy (vs. baseline and vs. ~0.25 chance).
- Guard: MMLU accuracy (unlearning must not tank it — target within a few points of baseline).
- Tamper-resistance: recovery curve shape; report recovered-gap fraction at each budget.
- A negative result (fast recovery ⇒ shallow safeguard) is a valid, expected, reportable outcome.

## Coding conventions

- Small before big: validate every script on a tiny data slice / a couple of steps before a
  full run. Print the plan and expected cost first.
- Deterministic, seeded, config-driven. No hardcoded paths — read from YAML/CLI.
- Keep dependencies minimal; prefer HF `Trainer` or a simple explicit loop over heavy frameworks.
- Fail loudly with actionable messages; never swallow exceptions silently.
- No network calls to fetch anything not declared here without flagging it.

## Verification checklist (do these before relying on assumptions)

- Confirm the current lm-eval task name for WMDP-bio and that `mmlu` runs as expected.
- Confirm the current location/name of the WMDP-bio forget (and retain) corpora.
- Confirm the current RMU reference-repo structure and its default hyperparameters for a
  model near this size; adapt rather than copy blindly.
- Confirm the target model's layer count before setting `rmu.layer_id`.

## Out of scope (do not do)

- Pretraining from scratch / data-filtering ("deep ignorance") experiments — out of scope here.
- Any hazardous-content generation, collection, or training.
- Distributed/multi-node training, custom CUDA, or exotic optimizers.
- Publishing or distributing a model that has been re-armed with hazardous capability.
